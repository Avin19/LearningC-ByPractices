1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Task: Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Display the results.
Hint: Use Console.ReadLine() to get user input and Convert.ToInt32() to convert it to an integer.



2. Looping and Conditional Statements
Task: Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
Hint: Use a for loop and if-else conditions.


3. Arrays and Array Manipulation
Task: Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 integers and stores them in an array. Then, sort the array in ascending order and display the sorted array.
Hint: Use Array.Sort() for sorting.



4. String Manipulation
Task: Write a program that takes a string from the user and reverses it. Display the reversed string.
Hint: Use a for loop or Array.Reverse().



5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects
Task: Create a Car class with properties like Make, Model, and Year. Write a method in the class that displays the car's details. Create an object of the Car class and call the method to display its details.
Hint: Use properties for encapsulation.


6. OOP - Inheritance
Task: Create a base class called Animal with a method MakeSound(). Create derived classes Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal and override the MakeSound() method to print "Bark" and "Meow" respectively. Instantiate both classes and call the MakeSound() method on each.
Hint: Use virtual and override keywords.


7. OOP - Polymorphism
Task: Extend the previous exercise by creating an array of Animal objects, including both Dog and Cat. Use a loop to call MakeSound() on each object in the array.
Hint: Use the Animal type for the array and dynamic method binding.



8. Collections and LINQ
Task: Create a list of integers. Write a LINQ query to find and display all the even numbers in the list.
Hint: Use List<int> and LINQ's Where() method.


9. Events and Delegates
Task: Create a delegate called Notify and an event of type Notify in a class ProcessData. Write a method StartProcess() in ProcessData that raises the event. In your Main() method, subscribe to the event and display a message when the event is triggered.
Hint: Use the event keyword and delegate.


10. File Handling
Task: Write a program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it. Display the word count.
Hint: Use File.ReadAllText() and String.Split().


11. Exception Handling
Task: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and divides the first number by the second. Implement exception handling to manage cases where the second number is zero.
Hint: Use try-catch blocks and catch DivideByZeroException.


12. Recursion
Task: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
Hint: The factorial of n is n * factorial(n-1) with a base case of factorial(1) = 1.


13. Multi-Dimensional Arrays
Task: Create a 3x3 matrix and write a function to transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns). Display the original and transposed matrices.
Hint: Use nested loops to swap elements.


14. Properties and Encapsulation
Task: Create a class Employee with properties Name, ID, and Salary. Ensure that Salary cannot be set to a negative value. Write a method to display the employee details.
Hint: Use property get and set with validation logic.


15. Generics
Task: Create a generic class Box<T> that can hold any type of value. Write methods to add a value, retrieve it, and display it. Test your class with different data types.
Hint: Use the generic type placeholder T.
These exercises range from basic to advanced levels, covering various fundamental and advanced concepts in C#.
